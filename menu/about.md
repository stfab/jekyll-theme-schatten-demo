Schatten (German: shadow) is a minimalistic Jekyll theme with modern UI. The name is inspired by the dark mode support of the theme. Its goal is to be simple, responsive, and fast. It's powered by Jekyll, a static site generator that allows you to create blogs and websites. 

Jekyll uses Markdown and Liquid to generate HTML pages from templates that you can easily add to your repository. Therefore, only a cheap web or file storage server is needed to host your site. Since many cloud platforms offer static website hosting for free, you can set up your own website with this theme with no cost.

## Features

Some of the original features of Schatten include:

- Minimal, responsive, and modern design
- Dark mode
- Configurable code highlighting themes
- SEO optimized
- SASS/SCSS support
- Responsive design

## Help

For more details on how to install and configure your site, check out the project [README](www.github.com/stfab/Schatten/README.md) in the GitHub repository or the introduction guides in this demo.
